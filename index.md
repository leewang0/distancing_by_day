# What is it?

As Coronavirus takes its toll around the world, how to help has become very
clear: stay home. This has been proven to reduce the infection rate by
preventing physical contact between infected people, and people generally. But
what if we can do even better?

**I plan on sticking to a routine of only going out some days of the week, and
not others.** How this might help is explained below.

## Time and space

The reason staying at home works is because if we do not share the same
location then there is no way for the virus to hop from person to person.
Embedded in there, though, is the assumption that we are sharing the same space
at the same time.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so if normal transmission and going out
looks like:

![normal transmission](/assets/images/normal_population.svg)
(Where the grey circles are people and the red area is an outbreak)

And social distancing looks like:

Then if people split up into two groups and go out on alternating days, what the
ideal case may end up looking like is:

![time distanced transmission](/assets/images/time_distanced_population.svg)
(Where the blue area went out some days and green area other days)

In this way, even if the people in the red circle had shown up to the same
supermarket, because they were not there at the same time, transmission would be
unable to occur.

## A call to action:

If you want to participate, here is a calendar dividing up each week in June in
a very basic way. Pick a team (BlueSky or GreenMeadow) and stick with it.
