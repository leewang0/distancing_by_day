# One Weird Trick:

As Coronavirus takes its toll around the world, how to help has become very
clear: stay home. This has been proven to reduce the infection rate by
preventing physical contact between infected people, and people generally. But
what if we can do even better?

**I personally plan on sticking to a routine of only going out some days of the
week, and not others.** How this might help is explained below.

## Time and Space

The reason staying at home works is because if we do not share the space
location, full stop, then there is no way for the virus to hop from person to
person. Embedded in there, though, is the assumption that we are sharing the
same space at the same time.

A picture (or in this case a scalable vector graphic) is worth a thousand words,
so if normal transmission and going out looks like:

And social distancing looks like:

Then people split up into two groups and go out on alternating days, what the
ideal case may end up looking like is:

Where the people in the blue region went out on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
and the green people had Thursday and Friday. In this way, even if the people
in the red circle had shown up to the same supermarket, because they were not
there at the same time, then transmission would be unable to occur.
